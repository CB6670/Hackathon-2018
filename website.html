        <img src="majestic me.jpg" id="imCool">
        <p class="mingus">Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Conner Stennett and I'm really excited to tell you about myself as well as show
            you why I'd make a great candidate for your scholarship. </p>



        <h1 class="mingus">Why Coding?</h1>
        <p class="mingus">Coding really wasn't something that I had considered before. In fact, I didn't even really know what coding was before
            I heard about FullStack University. Before I attended CodeSlo, coding was something to appreciate but ignore,
            an enigma to be praised but too difficult to comprehend. When I first heard about Ticket Into Tech, it was the
            perfect timing for me. I was at a crossroads in my life. I actually was in a dark place in my life at the time
            that I heard about FullStack. Cuesta Community College didn't fit with my personality, made me feel depressed,
            and made it hard for me to decide on a career path. To be completely honest, I felt like I was forced into a
            college life that I didn't want to subscribe to. It seemed like I was aimlessly paying for courses that didn't
            necessarily have a purpose for my future. I felt like Cuesta was a waste of my time and money because I didn't
            know what career I wanted to pursue, and I was really struggling there. Coding through CodeSlo and FullStack
            has given me a chance to do something that is truly unique, and has allowed me to focus on something that I am
            inspired and excited about--a skill that I feel is truly worthwhile to learn.
        </p>



        <h1 class="mingus">Coding is Hard!</h1>
        <p class="mingus">When I first started CodeSlo, I thought I had made sure not to underestimate code, and I felt I was keeping an open
            mind while learning it. I quickly realized once the CodeSlo class started that even though I thought I was prepared
            for everything the class could throw at me, I was very wrong. There was a whole new world with its own language
            to explore and navigate. Learning parts of JavaScript has actually turned out to be one of, if not the hardest,
            thing I have accomplished so far in my life.

        <h1 class="mingus">Where I'm at right now.</h1>
        <p class="mingus">
            I'm really proud of the progess that I've made in the CodeSlo class. I feel like I have made tremendous improvements in my
            ability to read and code JavaScript during the past eight weeks. I went from not knowing anything about JavaScript,
            to having a decent knowledge of the intermediate level of this language. I also feel that the hackathon experience
            was extremely educational and led me to fixing some issues with my coding that I didn't even know I had.

        <h1 class="mingus">How I can benefit the FullStack program</h1>
        <p class="mingus">
            I genuinely believe that a coding career is what I would love to do in the future. I believe that with the expert teaching
            and care that FullStack teachers bring to their bootcamp, I can flourish in this area. When I started to learn
            code through CodeSlo, I was really intimidated. I thought that I would never come to understand how to effectively
            use JavaScript. Since starting CodeSlo, my confidence in myself has grown leaps and bounds. After going through
            the program, I think that my ability to work with code has finally shown results that I can be proud of. I genuinely
            believe that if I get accepted into the bootcamp, I will thrive. I am confident that I will learn and grow so
            much that once I graduate, I will impress so many of the people that I work with that they will come back to
            the FullStack program again and again to look for new candidates for hire. I am really eager to learn more and
            become an expert in this field. I hope you strongly consider me when choosing candidates for both the bootcamp
            program and the scholarship.
